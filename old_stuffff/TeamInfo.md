## Project Summary
TeamID: Team-080
TeamName: HighLevel

Our group selects “Steam Game Data” as our dataset, and the data is from the Project Track 1 Datasets. For attributes and information in the database, we plan to store queryId, name of the game, does this game provide discount, is this game free, allowed platforms of the game, requirements in each platform, game categories and so on. Users can get related information by searching keywords of one game. Also, the function of filer and ranking in the website will provide some recommendations of games for users according to their requirements. What’s more, the website provides the function of comments for each game so users could communicate with other users about their interested game. Then users could express their thoughts about the game to provide more real views for users of the website. Also, each comment can be replied. For achieving the function of comments, we will create a database to store content of comments and insert these comments into our database. Also, the page of the application needs to be updated in real time.
